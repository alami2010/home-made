                        <li> 16. Events Outside Our Control
                            <ul>

                                <li>   Neither party shall be in breach of the Contract nor liable for delay in performing, or
                            failure
                            to perform, any of its obligations under the Contract if such delay or failure result from
                            events, circumstances or causes beyond its reasonable control. If the period of delay or
                            non-performance continues for 4 weeks, the party not affected may terminate the Contract by
                            giving 14 days written notice to the affected party.</li>
                    </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li> 17. Other Important Terms
                            <ul>

                                <li>   17.1 We may transfer this agreement to someone else. We may transfer Our rights and
                            obligations
                            under these terms to another organisation.</li>

                                <li>  17.2 You need Our consent to transfer Your rights to someone else</li>

                                <li>    17.3 Nobody else has any rights under this contract. This contract is between You and Us. No</li>
                            other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms

                                <li>    17.4 If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force. Each
                            of
                            the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority
                            decides
                            that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and
                            effect.</li>

                                <li>    17.5 Even if We delay in enforcing this contract, We can still enforce it later. If We do
                            not
                            insist immediately that You do anything You are required to do under these terms, or if We
                            delay
                            in taking steps against You in respect of Your breaking this contract, that will not mean
                            that
                            You do not have to do those things and it will not prevent Us taking steps against You at a
                            later date. For example, if You miss a payment and We do not chase you but We continue to
                            provide the Services, We can still require you to make the payment at a later date.</li>

                                <li>   17.6 Which laws apply to this contract and where you may bring legal proceedings.</li>

                                <li>     If you are a consumer, please note that these terms of use, their subject matter and their
                            formation, are governed by Estonian law. You and we both agree that the courts of Estonia
                            will
                            have exclusive jurisdiction except that if you are a resident of another EU country</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
